# Food Ordering Demo using Python OOP

## Overview
This project simulates a food ordering system using Python object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It includes classes for food items and drinks, as well as a script for order management.

## Directory Structure
- `drinks.py`: Python script defining the `Drinks` class for drink menu items.
- `foods.py`: Python script defining the `Foods` class for food menu items.
- `menu_items.py`: Python script defining the `Menu_Item` class as the parent class for food and drink menu items.
- `script.py`: Python script containing the main order management system.

## Code Description
The `script.py` file contains the main code for the order management system. It provides a function `buy()` to display menu options for foods and drinks, take user input for orders, calculate the total amount, and print the total amount.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/abhayverma6300/FoodOrderingUsingPython.git
    cd 'FoodOrderingUsingPython'
    ```

2. Ensure all necessary Python scripts are present in the directory.

## Usage
1. Run the `script.py` file to simulate the food ordering system.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to place orders for foods and drinks.
3. The script calculates the total amount based on the orders and prints the total amount.

## Additional Information
- Adjustments can be made to the menu items, prices, and order processing logic as needed.
- This project serves as a demonstration of Python OOP concepts in a practical scenario.
